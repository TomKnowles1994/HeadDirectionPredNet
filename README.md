## Contents

### Data

Links to datasets used in the paper with code to generate more from ROSBags.

### Figures

Figures used in the paper, with code to generate where appropriate.

### NEST

Jupyter notebook files that can build and run the Ring Attractor Head Direction Cell model, outputting Idiothetic Estimates of head direction.
